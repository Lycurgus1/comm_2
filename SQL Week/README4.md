#SQL Notes 22/06/2020
- Database
    - Repositry of Data, an organised collection of tables (columns, rows)
    - Structured set of data held in computer. SQL is a management system for it

- Needs to be structured
    - So contains right amount of info, and can be quiried. Labels therefore needed. 
 
- Column - Correspond to attributes of object
- Row - One set of attributes for one instance (Records, tuples)
- Table - Rows & Columns for entity (also called file)
- DBMS - Database management system
- Entity - whole dataset

- Relational databases
    - Primary key for each that is unique
    - Relatiionship based on primary, foreign key relationship

- Primary Key
    - Not null, cant be duplicated
    - Will never change in future e.g. bank account no. may close
    - May be composite (Two primary keys used in junction table and when needed)

- Foreign Key
    - Can be duplicated
    - can be null
    - No uniqueness requirement
    - Establishes relationship with primary key

#Types of databses
- Flat-file
    - Stores everything in one table e.g excel, good for small datasets
- Relational
    - Seperate data into seperate tables
    - Linked through keys
- Big data
    - MongDB, Verica
    - For data analytics, Business Intel
    - Digital Age and IoT

- Database relationships
    - One to one. One employee has one NHS ID
    - One to many. One customer has many purchases
    - Many to many. Many students on one courses
    - Creates two way relationship, so needs junction box.
