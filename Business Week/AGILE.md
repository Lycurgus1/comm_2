##Agile in detail
###Three Amigos
- Refers to the primary perspectives to examine an increment before, during, after
    - Business - What are we trying to solve
    - Development - What about this, what could possibly happen
    - Test - What about this, what could possibly happen
    - People holding these perspectives should collaborate to define what to do and agree on how they know it is done correctly. The result of such a collaboration results in a clear description of an increment and shared understanding for the team 
    - Good practice to review increments of the products that have been implemented to make sure its correct form those different perspectives
     
**Expected Benefits**
- Builds a shared understanding about the intent of an increment of work. Identifies misunderstandings and confusion early, allowing learning to happen sooner in the delivery of an increment of work.
- Provides a reasonable guard rail for the number of people who should be involved in discussions about any given increment of work.

**Common Pitfalls**
- Limiting or expanding three amigo theory too much.  If there are other stakeholders who are relevant to an increment of work, include them in the discussion, but team should be as small as possible.
- Three amigo discussions become regularly scheduled meetings and are treated as another event for the team to do instead of as a handy guide for perspectives to include.

###Starfish retrospective
**Divides board into 5 areas**
-	Keep doing
-	Less of
-	More of
-	Stop doing
-	Start doing
    
###Persona
**Personas are made up users for ensuring smooth user experience in major projects**
- Can include relevant attributes such as:
    -	Tech literacy
    -	Needs of that user
    -	Potential problems they may have
### Information radiators
**Large graph showing representation of project information**
- Could use burn down chart
- Used for transparency in the workspace

### Scrum artefacts
**Product vision:**
The aim for the product
Can use structure to plan it out:
-	For council staff
-	Who want to process rent concerns
-	The product is new database software
-	That helps data access
-	Unlike McKinsey
-	Our product will provide a radical new data access UI

**Sprint goal (end product)**
- End product aimed to be produced by a sprint
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Definition of done
- Burn down chart

### Scrum roles
- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Scrum development team

### Scrum events
- Backlog planning
- Sprint planning
- Sprint
- Daily stand up
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective

### Sprint review 
- Reviews sprint review weekly, looks back at work done with product owner

### Sprint retrospective
Reviews sprint based on dev team and scrum master in terms of work methods, potential improvements etc. 

### Root cause analysis 
- Ask why five times
- Gets to root cause of problem
- Fixes root cause, possibly involving talking to the larger firm structure e.g. 

### Agile Values
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Principles
-	Highest priority is to satisfy customer through early and continuous delivery
-	Welcome changing requirements even late in development, change in agile provides advantages compared to others
-	Deliver working software frequently. Preferred shorter timescale. Primary measure of progress
-	Business people and developers must work together daily
-	Build projects around motivated individuals
-	Must efficient method of communication is face to face conversation
-	Agile processes promote sustainable development, pace should be maintained indefinitely
-	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enchances agility
-	Simplicity (maximizing work not done) is essential
-	Best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self organising times 
-	At regular intervals team should reflect on how to become more effective. 

### Short summary of what Agile is
- Agile is a method
- Scrum is a framework
- Agile is key to ensuring speedy delivery
- Constant delivery and ensuring collaboration â€“principles sustainable pace and changing requirements
